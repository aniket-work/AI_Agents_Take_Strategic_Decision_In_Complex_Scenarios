However, this may also lead to reduced competition, potentially hindering innovation and limiting choices for customers. Strategic advantages include streamlined operations, expanded R&D capabilities, and a stronger portfolio of patents and technologies.

**Potential Regulatory Issues:**

1. Reduced competition in key markets (e.g., cloud services, artificial intelligence)
2. Potential stifling of innovation due to market dominance
3. Increased scrutiny from antitrust authorities
4. Compliance requirements for divestitures or other remedies
